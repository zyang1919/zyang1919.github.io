      <!-- General Introduction -->
      <p class="research-intro">
        My research focuses on developing Bayesian and likelihood-based statistical
        methodologies for complex biomedical data. I am particularly interested in
        modeling structural dependence, population heterogeneity, and informative
        observation mechanisms in longitudinal, survival, and high-dimensional
        genomic studies. My work integrates theoretical development, computational
        implementation in R, and applied collaboration in biostatistics and
        bioinformatics.

          <h3>Differential Methylation Regions Detection</h3>
          <p>
            DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression
            without changing the DNA sequence itself. Abnormal methylation patterns
            are frequently associated with cancer and other complex diseases.
            Detecting these abnormal patterns at the regional level is a central
            problem in modern bioinformatics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, methylation data are high-dimensional and noisy.
            Nearby CpG sites are spatially correlated, subjects exhibit
            biological heterogeneity, and signals are often weak. Standard
            site-by-site testing procedures tend to ignore regional structure,
            which reduces statistical power and complicates biological interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these challenges, I developed a Bayesian multistage
            Markov chain Monte Carlo (MMCMC) framework that adaptively
            partitions genomic regions and evaluates regional differences
            using Bayes factors. The methodology improves detection accuracy
            while preserving biological interpretability and is implemented
            in the R package <i>mmcmcBayes</i>.

          <h3>Outcome-Dependent Follow-Up in Longitudinal Studies</h3>
          <p>
            In many longitudinal and electronic health record (EHR) studies,
            patient monitoring is not conducted at fixed intervals. Instead,
            follow-up intensity often depends on a patient’s recent health
            status or observed outcomes. This outcome-dependent follow-up
            mechanism introduces informative observation times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ignoring this dependence between the outcome process and the
            monitoring mechanism can lead to biased estimation and distorted
            inference, particularly when patients with worsening conditions
            are monitored more frequently.
          </p>
          <p>
            I develop discrete-time hazard modeling frameworks that jointly
            characterize outcome trajectories and monitoring processes.
            The approach incorporates transition-based structures and
            machine learning methods to estimate patient risk levels that
            influence monitoring intensity, providing bias-corrected and
            interpretable inference for applied clinical research.

        <!-- Alpha Mixture -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>α-Mixture Models in Survival Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Survival data often exhibit heterogeneity due to latent
            subpopulations and unobserved risk factors. Classical survival
            models assume homogeneous populations and may fail to capture
            complex hazard interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finite mixture models offer flexibility by representing survival
            distributions as weighted combinations of component distributions,
            but traditional formulations may lack interpretability.
          </p>
          <p>
            I develop Bayesian α-mixture survival models that introduce a
            parameter controlling dependence between component hazards.
            This formulation provides greater modeling flexibility while
            maintaining tractable likelihood structures. The framework
            includes hierarchical extensions and posterior inference via
            Markov chain Monte Carlo, implemented in the R package
            <i>alpmixBayes</i>.
