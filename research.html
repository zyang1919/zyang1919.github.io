          <h3>Differentially Methylated Regions Detection</h3>
          <p>
            DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression 
            without changing the DNA sequence itself. When methylation patterns go 
            wrong, they are often linked to cancer and other complex diseases. 
            Detecting these abnormal patterns, especially at the regional level, is 
            a central problem in modern bioinformatics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, methylation data are high-dimensional and noisy. Nearby 
            CpG sites are correlated, subjects can vary substantially, and signals 
            are often weak. Standard site-by-site testing methods tend to ignore 
            this regional structure, which can reduce statistical power and make 
            biological interpretation harder.
          </p>
          <p>
          To address these challenges, I developed a Bayesian multistage Markov chain 
          Monte Carlo framework that adaptively partitions genomic regions 
          and evaluates regional differences using Bayes factors. This approach improves 
          detection accuracy while preserving biological interpretability. The methodology 
          is implemented in the R package <i>mmcmcBayes</i>.

          <h3>Outcome-Dependent Follow-Up in Longitudinal Studies</h3>
          <p>
            In many longitudinal and electronic health record (EHR) studies, 
            patient monitoring is not conducted at fixed intervals. Instead, 
            follow-up intensity often depends on a patient’s recent health status 
            or observed outcomes. This outcome-dependent follow-up (ODFL) mechanism 
            introduces informative observation times that violate the standard 
            assumption of independent monitoring schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring the dependence between the outcome process and the monitoring 
          mechanism can lead to biased estimation and distorted inference. 
          In particular, when patients with worsening conditions are observed 
          more frequently, naive longitudinal models may overestimate disease 
          progression or mischaracterize treatment effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this issue, I develop discrete-time hazard modeling frameworks 
          that jointly characterize the outcome trajectory and the follow-up process. 
          The monitoring mechanism is modeled using discrete-time transition structures, 
          allowing the follow-up intensity to depend on previous outcomes. In addition, 
          I incorporate machine learning methods to estimate patient risk levels that 
          influence monitoring intensity. The goal is to reduce bias while keeping the models 
          interpretable for applied clinical research.

          <h3>Mixture Models in Survival Analysis (Collaborator)</h3>
          <p>
            Survival data arising from biomedical and clinical studies often exhibit 
            heterogeneity due to unobserved subpopulations, varying risk profiles, 
            or latent biological mechanisms. Classical survival models, such as the 
            Cox proportional hazards model or parametric lifetime models, typically 
            assume a homogeneous population structure and may fail to capture complex 
            risk dynamics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finite mixture models provide a flexible framework for accommodating 
            population heterogeneity by representing the survival distribution as a 
            weighted combination of component distributions. However, traditional 
            mixture formulations may lack interpretability and may not adequately 
            model intermediate dependence structures between competing components.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these limitations, we develop Bayesian α-mixture survival models, 
            which generalize classical mixture frameworks by introducing a parameter 
            that controls the dependence and interaction between component hazards. 
            This formulation allows for greater modeling flexibility while maintaining 
            tractable likelihood structures. The methodology includes hierarchical 
            extensions, posterior inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo, and 
            computational implementation in R through the <i>alpmixBayes</i> package.
